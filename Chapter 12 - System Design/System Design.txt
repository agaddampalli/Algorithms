System Design:

1. Features 
2. Availability - does need to be always up
3. Latency Performace -- UI or background job
4. Scalability - number of users
5. Durability -- Data should maintain integrity, 
6. Class Diagram -- Objects and Classes
7. Security and Privacy -- design an authentication system
8. Cost effective

Concepts to know

Vertical vs horizontal scaling -- vertical(add more cpu and memory) horizontal(add more hosts)

CAP theorem -- Consistency Availability Partition Tolerance

ACID vs BASE -- ACID (Atomic Consistent Isolation Durability)(Relational Databased) BASE (Basic Availability Soft State Eventual Consistency)(NoSql)

Partitioning/Sharding -- Split the data (consistent hashing)

Consistent Hashing -- Must Read

Optimistic vs pessimistic locking -- Optimistic (get the lock before committing the data) pessimistic (acqiure locks before hand)

Strong vs eventual consistency

RelationalDB vs NoSQL

Types of NoSQL
     Key value
     Wide column
     Document-based
     Graph-based

Caching

Data center/racks/hosts

CPU/memory/Hard drives/Network bandwidth

Random vs sequential read/writes to disk

HTTP vs http2(multiple requests on single call) vs WebSocket 

TCP/IP model

ipv4 - 32bit vs ipv6 - 128bit (IP routing works)

TCP (reliable) vs UDP (unrelaible) 

DNS lookup -- how dns is converted to ip address

Https & TLS -- secuirty

Public key infrastructure and certificate authority(CA)

Symmetric (AES) vs asymmetric encryption

Load Balancer -- l4 or l7

CDNs & Edges 

Bloom filters and Count-Min sketch

Paxos -- consensus over distributed hosts
		 Leader election

Design patterns and Object-oriented design

Virtual machines and containers

Pub-sub architecture 

MapReduce

Multithreading, locks, synchronization, CAS(compare and set)

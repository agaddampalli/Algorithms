Web hosting:

1. Shared hosting -- where the system resources are shared by multiple applications
2. VPS'es -- virtual private shared hosts, where each application has its own virtual machine and the resources to these are managed by the vendor like VM ware
3. Vertical scaling -- increasing the RAM or processors on a machine, but we can scale only to a real world limit
4. Horizontal scaling -- Multiple servers to host the application
5. Load balancer -- When we have multiple servers, to manage the requests (IPV4 - 32bit, IPV6 - 128 bit), nginix
6. RAID: Redundant array of independent disks, maintain redundant data to improve partition tolerance
7. Session state : Mysql cache, cookies or memcached
8. nginx
